# TK Builder
Creating UI made easy with TK Builder

TK Builder was started as a hobby project by Faraaz Kurawle in order to ease and save his time in creating GUI with Tkinter in Python and is the result of his hard work, investment of time and knowledge.

This project is his first full fledget application which is intended to be used by the opensource community.

It all started with Faraaz building on new projects but completing none of them due to the time it takes to design the User Interface. So he decided to explore for tools to assist in his projects.

Many tools are present on the web for example Pygubu-Designer and PAGE, and none provided one and only requirment: **Interact with widgets using code.**
Therefore on set his journey for creating his own Tkinter Builder!

Develeopers who have used tkinter as thier GUI may have noticed how much time it takes to design just a single frame! Tweeking with colors and geometry managers take so much time since even a minute of change requires whole application to be restarted.

With TK Builder you can change the UI in the runtime, which saves your precise time getting wasted by restarting the whole application. It allows you to use and make changes to almost all widgets available in Tkinter and Themed Tkinter.

Some Major use case of Tkinter Builder may be:
	1. Education: Teachers can use this to demostrate each option of a Tkinter widget.
	2. Development: Developers Who want to build application using Python and tkinter.

Tkinter Designer is a RAD(Rapid Application Development) tool which is used to design User Interface using Tkinter. 

The whole application is designed to be **dependency free** and hence to run Tkinter Builder you only need Python 3.x.

Execute Code Textarea allows you to type the UI code and reflects the changes made to the specified widget under update UI window or .  It can be use to add images, Tkinter Variables, add widget data for example create_circle in tk.Canvas. The only condition to access widgets is to use root.nametowidget().

Shortcuts:
 - Drag a widget or use arrow keys to move widget.
 - Right click on the widgets to edit its properties.
